# 2560. House Robber IV

題目網址 : [2560. House Robber IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/description)

## 題目描述

There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he **refuses to steal from adjacent homes**.

The **capability** of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least `k` houses.

Return _the **minimum** capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least_ `k` _houses_.

## 限制條件

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
- `1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2`

## 解題思路

使用二分搜尋法找出某個金額是否能滿足 k 次偷盜，如果滿足則最小的能可金額可以提高，否則降低最大可能金額

## Code

C++版本

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Store the maximum nums value in maxReward.
        int minReward = 1, maxReward = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end()),
            totalHouses = nums.size();

        // Use binary search to find the minimum reward possible.
        while (minReward < maxReward) {
            int midReward = (minReward + maxReward) / 2;
            int possibleThefts = 0;

            for (int index = 0; index < totalHouses; ++index) {
                if (nums[index] <= midReward) {
                    possibleThefts += 1;
                    index++;  // Skip the next house to maintain the
                              // non-adjacent condition
                }
            }

            if (possibleThefts >= k)
                maxReward = midReward;
            else
                minReward = midReward + 1;
        }

        return minReward;
    }
};
```
