# 1598. Crawler Log Folder

題目網址 : [1598. Crawler Log Folder](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description)

## 題目描述

The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a _change folder_ operation.

The operations are described below:

- `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, **remain in the same folder**).
- `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.
- `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is **guaranteed to always exist**).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations._

## 限制條件

- <code>1 <= logs.length <= 10<sup>3</sup></code>
- `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
- `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
- `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
- Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.

## 解題思路

使用一個 `count` 並遍歷每個記錄如果是 `../` 就 `-1` 但不能減到小於 0，如果是 `./` 就不動作，其它的路徑就 `+1`

## Code

C++版本

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<string>& logs) {
        int count = 0;
        for(string& log : logs){
            if(log == "../")
                count = std::max(0 , count - 1);
            else if(log != "./")
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

C# 版本

```C#
public class Solution {
    public int MinOperations(string[] logs) {
        int count = 0;
        foreach(string log in logs){
            if(log == "../")
                count = Math.Max(0 , count - 1);
            else if(log != "./")
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

Go 版本

```go
func minOperations(logs []string) int {
    count := 0
    for _ , log := range logs {
        if log == "../" {
            count = count - 1
            if count < 0 {
                count = 0
            }
        }else if log != "./" {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```
