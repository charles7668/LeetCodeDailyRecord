# 3208. Alternating Groups II

題目網址 : [3208. Alternating Groups II](https://leetcode.com/problems/alternating-groups-ii/description)

## 題目描述

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers `colors` and an integer `k`. The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:

- `colors[i] == 0` means that tile `i` is **red**.
- `colors[i] == 1` means that tile `i` is **blue**.

An **alternating** group is every `k` contiguous tiles in the circle with **alternating** colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its **left** and **right** tiles).

Return the number of **alternating** groups.

**Note** that since `colors` represents a **circle**, the **first** and the **last** tiles are considered to be next to each other.

## 限制條件

- <code>3 <= colors.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `0 <= colors[i] <= 1`
- `3 <= k <= colors.length`

## 解題思路

使用 sliding window

## Code

C++版本

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        // Extend the array to handle circular sequences
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            colors.push_back(colors[i]);
        }

        int length = colors.size();
        int result = 0;
        // Initialize the bounds of the sliding window
        int left = 0;
        int right = 1;

        while (right < length) {
            // Check if the current color is the same as the last one
            if (colors[right] == colors[right - 1]) {
                // Pattern breaks, reset window from the current position
                left = right;
                right++;
                continue;
            }

            // Expand the window to the right
            right++;

            // Skip counting sequence if its length is less than k
            if (right - left < k) continue;

            // Record a valid sequence and shrink window from the left to search
            // for more
            result++;
            left++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
