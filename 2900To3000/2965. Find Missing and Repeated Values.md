# 2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values

題目網址 : [2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-and-repeated-values/description)

## 題目描述

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n * n` with values in the range <code>[1, n<sup>2</sup>]</code>. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which appears **twice** and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers `a` and `b`.

Return _a **0-indexed** integer array_ `ans` _of size_ `2` _where_ `ans[0]` _equals to_ `a` _and_ `ans[1]` _equals to_ `b`_._

## 限制條件

- `2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n`
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is not equal to any of the grid members.
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.
- For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` except two of them there is exatly one pair of `i, j` that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `grid[i][j] == x`.

## 解題思路

使用 hash map 來記錄

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMissingAndRepeatedValues(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int missing = -1, repeat = -1;

        // Store frequency of each number in the grid
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (auto& row : grid) {
            for (int num : row) {
                freq[num]++;
            }
        }

        // Check numbers from 1 to n^2 to find missing and repeated values
        for (int num = 1; num <= n * n; num++) {
            if (!freq.count(num)) {
                missing = num;  // Number not present in grid
            } else if (freq[num] == 2) {
                repeat = num;  // Number appears twice
            }
        }

        return {repeat, missing};
    }
};
```
